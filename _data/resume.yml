    Hello, I'm Lomas Persad.<br>
    I currently work at **Mayo Clinic** as a *research fellow*. I am an *Imperial College London*
    graduate and I have a passion for biomechanics research and data visualization.
    I am a mechanical engineer with over four years of experience in biomechanics research.
    In particular, I am interested in understanding the mechanisms of human locomotion and how
    healthy muscles function  within the musculoskeletal system. I  also interested in and have
    conducted research in  the  field  of  sports  and injury biomechanics.
    I am a quick learner and natural problem solver. Please read more [about me](/about/).

      ***GRASL research project***-This study aims to quantify the active and
      passive mechanical properties of the human gracilis muscle by collecting
      *in vivo* data intraoperatively. Responsibilities include recruiting
      potential patients, designing and simulating engineering solutions for
      experimental implementation, calibration of research equipment, maintenance
      and troubleshooting of research devices, developing custom research software,
      modifying the intraoperative experimental protocol, collecting and analyzing
      experimental data, communicate findings to all stakeholders via reports and
      presentations and publication of peer-reviewed manuscripts in collaboration
      with other members of a research team., a cornerstone of SAP HANA, now aims
      to bring the in-memory technology to the cloud where it acts as a single
      gateway to data of any size to harness the power of data wherever it resides
      and ensure the platform for intelligent enterprise.
