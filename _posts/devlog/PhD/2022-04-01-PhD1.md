My graduate research focused on measuring full body kinematics from cricket bowlers as well as evaluating their risk of suffering shoulder impingement injury. Contributions to the research area included development of a scapula tracking device to more accurately measure shoulder joint rotations, technical advances made to the already validated National Shoulder Model (NSM) that is used at Imperial College for all upper limb modeling in research and finally provide a novel dataset for scapula kinematics based on upper arm circumduction. Research was conducted in collaboration with the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) in London, who allowed the used of their facilities and athletes

The aim of this thesis was to test the hypotheses above and investigate potential shoulder injury risk in cricket bowlers. Cricket bowling involves one of the more complex sporting tasks where the arm goes through a large range of motion during circumduction to project the cricket ball at varying degrees of speed and spin where injury surveillance research estimates that over 20% of cricket injuries are related to the upper limb with the glenohumeral joint being the second most injured site. Similar to other overhead athletes, cricket bowlers have a prevalence of shoulder injury and pain with loss of internal rotation. It is hypothesised that this is due to large distraction forces and muscle imbalance at the glenohumeral joint. A second, specific hypothesis is that bowlers who have greater internal rotation after delivering the cricket ball are more likely to suffer from impingement. The motivation for this study is derived from these hypotheses.

### No ball rule
Upper arm rotation is the largest (>60%) contributor to ball speed where internal rotation of the upper arm plays a major role (Zhang, 2011; Stronach et al., 2014). This is followed by contributions from thorax rotation, pelvis rotation, linear velocity of the pelvis and forearm rotation (Zhang, 2011). Hussain (2011) showed that the increase in ball speed was increasingly greater than the decrease in ball speed associated with shorter arm length when the elbow was flexed from 5° to 35° (Figure 3.5).
