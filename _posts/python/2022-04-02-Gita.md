This analysis focuses on one of the most popular Hindu texts -the **Bhagavad Gita**.
<!--more-->
<br>
The Bhagavad Gita deals with the true nature of ourselves, the universe and our relationship to the divine. It is guide for life and necessary for understanding our place in this world! This holy manuscript presents these teachings in the form of a spiritual dialogue between Shri Krishna and his disciple Arujna just before they are about to fight in a great war. The Lord convinces Arjuna that he must fight even though it is against his own family, transforming him from a state of emotional distress to one of focus and dutifulness.
The Bhagavad Gita was written in Sanskrit, which in itself possess an immense vocabulary perfect for expressing and capturing the spiritual concepts being expounded. The language and its words are of particular significance because it represents the worlds spoken by the divine himself, not to mention that Sanskrit lends itself perfectly to being used as a computer language for [Artificial Intelligence](https://www.bhashaneeti.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/466-466-1-PB.pdf).<br>
 This brings us to the rationale for this work. The application of science. Indeed science has its place in this scripture as it contains the science of knowing the absolute truth or *Brahma Vidyā.* This is demonstrated by the fact that the Bhagavad Gita is sought after by so many scholars, philosophers, famous physicists, celebrities and anyone who seeks to know supreme knowledge. We are all equal and humbled before this magnificent scripture.<br>
This analysis of the scripture is merely an academic exercise and offers some insights that will hopefully peak your interest to discover what countless others have seen and discovered before....our true self. This author highly recommends that the next step is to read it yourself.

Concluding remarks


*BG 6.35*

> “श्रीभगवानुवाच |
असंशयं महाबाहो मनो दुर्निग्रहं चलम् |
अभ्यासेन तु कौन्तेय वैराग्येण च गृह्यते || 35|| <br>
śhrī bhagavān uvācha
asanśhayaṁ mahā-bāho mano durnigrahaṁ chalam
abhyāsena tu kaunteya vairāgyeṇa cha gṛihyate <br>
 Lord Krishna said: O mighty-armed son of Kunti, what you say is correct; the mind is indeed very difficult to restrain. But by practice and detachment, it can be controlled.”
