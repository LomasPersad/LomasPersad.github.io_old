I am an *Imperial College London* graduate and I have a passion for biomechanics research and data visualization. I am a mechanical engineer with over four years of experience in biomechanics research. In particular, I am interested in understanding the mechanisms of human locomotion and how healthy muscles function  within the musculoskeletal system. I  also interested in and have conducted research in  the  field  of  sports  and injury biomechanics. I am a quick learner and natural problem solver.
